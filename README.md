#### Education

- member of the HSE and VK School of Engineering and Mathematics
- 2022 - present: master's degree, Higher School of Economics, GPA: 8.65  
  Machine Learning and Data Analysis  
  Thesis: Representation Learning for Model-based RL  

- 2018 - 2022: bachelor's degree, Moscow Aviation Institute   
  Fundamental Computer Science and Information Technology  
  Thesis: Word Sense Disambiguation in Literary Texts

#### Work experience
 - 06.2023 - 12.2023: Internship at Yandex.Weather, main tasks:
     - weather recognition from video
     - combining precipitation and cloud forecast on the precipitation map
  
   During the internship, many hypotheses regarding weather prediction were tested. Additionally, satellite data was studied, which will be used as additional data in model training.

  - 01.2024 - present: Research intern at the laboratory of bio- and chemoinformatics at the Higher School of Economics  
    The task is related to modeling the protein structure of vasopressin AVPR1B.

#### Project activity
- 10.2022 - 05.2023, Weather recognition from video  
     Research project for Yandex.Weather, during which data was found and collected, work was carried out with the architecture of the MoViNet network. Experiments were carried out both with the classical architecture (selection of hyperparameters, working with data), and with a modified one, with the addition of inputs for optical flow, ensemble.
- 10.2023 - present, master's thesis Representation Learning for Model-based RL  
     The challenge is to improve state representations to work in noisy environments.

- 02.2024 - present, Fast mobile face reenactment  
     Application project for VK. The task is to train, distill and prepare for inference of a compact neural network suitable for real-time output on mobile devices.

#### Skills
 - Programming languages: Python, SQL, Haskell. In progress: Scala. C++ at the program reading level.
 - Tools: pytorch, numpy, sklearn, pandas, opencv, tensorflow, jax, git

Main areas \ research interests: deep learning - computer vision, reinforcement learning, NLP.
